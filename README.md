# PyBer_Analysis

## PyBer Analysis Overview

The purpose of the analysis provided, is to look at key insights surrounding supply (drivers), price (fare), and demand (trips) for the company PyBer. This analysis seeks to compare 3 different markets based on city type - Urban, Rural,and Suburban - in order to gain a better understanding of business trends and profitability. 

## Results

### Total Rides

It should not be surprising, that Urban areas have significantly more rides than Suburban and Rural, in fact, they have more than Suburban and Rural combined. Given that urban cities are more densely populated than rural towns, this trend should have been expected.

### Total Drivers

Similarly to the observations made for total rides, total drivers follows the same trends. There are substantially more drivers readily available within Urban cities than the two alternative markets. 

This is a key observation to note and raises a question surrounding do total rides dictate the number of drivers in an area, or do total drivers dictate the use of the service and therefore ride trends.

### Average Fare per Ride and Driver

Fares range within ~$10 from rural to urban. Rural fares are the most expensive sitting at (on average) $34.62 per ride and $55.49 per driver. On the other end of the spectrum, we see Urban city fares being much more affordable at $24.53 per ride and $16.57 per driver. Sitting right in the middle of this price range, we have Suburban at $30.97 per ride and $39.50 per driver.

### Total Fare by City Type

The top earning city type for PyBer is Urban. With only a $10 difference from the most expensive fare, the large demand for rides within Urban centres has lead to a total collection of $39,854.38 in fares. On the other end of the spectrum, although Rural cities provide the highest average fare per ride and driver, the very low demand has lead to only $4327.93 in total fares.

## Summary

Throughout this analysis we have been able to identify areas of strength, and key areas for improvement. We were able to identify our strongest market as our Urban city centres. With a seamless combination of demand and supply, the appealing prices offered coupled with consistent use of our services has lead to impressive earnings. Meanwhile, our Rural markets are lagging much further behind in the value they offer to us, due to a lack of use.

## 3 Key Takeaways

### 1: Reassess the need for PyBer in Rural markets.

It is extremely important that we understand why Rural markets are not using our services. If it is due to a lack of supply of drivers, we should be targeting expanding further into these areas to take advantage of this market opportunity. Conversely, if it is just due to a lack of value viewed by consumers, would it be beneficial to cut costs and cease use all together. 

The key behind this, is that PyBer needs to invest into further reasearch for understanding its consumers within this market. 

### 2: Opportunities to Expand in Urban Cities

Now recognizing how full of opportunities and demand urban areas are, PyBer should take an initiative to continue expanding in these areas. Features such as referal links could be extremely beneficial to gain popularity through word of mouth, while also providing continued value to existing users through rewards for referals. This helps us show we value our existing customers, while potentially seeking out new ones in this extremely strong market.

### 3: Strengthen our Services in Suburban Markets.

Our market activity within Suburban areas isn't fantastic, but also isn't a detriment to the company - this should be viewed as more of an area for opportunity. Strategic marketing targetted towards individuals in these areas could provide an added push to perceived value of the service PyBer has to offer. After extending our attention and reach, trends (fares and ride quantity) should continue to be monitored to understand the impacts of our efforts, and the value perceived in Suburban areas.
